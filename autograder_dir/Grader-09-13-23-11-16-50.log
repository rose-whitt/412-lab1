	0 lines with errors missed

Testing Conformance	(If we got this far, the tar file worked.)

	Found message, but ERROR was not in uppercase (1)
	Produced 'ERROR' message on missing or bad file name
	Help message check found all options

Quick Scalability Test:
	(For a more accurate test, run the auto-timer)

	T8k.i:  	0.029064 seconds
	T16k.i:  	0.030626999999999998 seconds
	T32k.i:  	0.028951 seconds
	T64k.i:  	0.028305 seconds
	T128k.i:  	0.028717 seconds

	The code may not work; 3 codes showed minimal growth
	This effect may also be timer variability.
	Run the auto-timer to see more accurate results.

	Scaling appears to be linear.

Scoring (on the provided test blocks):

	Correctness:	100.0%
	Conformance:	87.5%

	Run the auto-timer to see Scalability results
