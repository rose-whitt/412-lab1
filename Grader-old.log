Testing Conformance	(If we got this far, the tar file worked.)

	Produced 'ERROR' message on missing or bad file name
	Help message check found all options

Quick Scalability Test:
	(For a more accurate test, run the auto-timer)

	T8k.i:  	0.005487 seconds
	T16k.i:  	0.007016 seconds
	T32k.i:  	0.011512 seconds
	T64k.i:  	0.020375 seconds
	T128k.i:  	0.036274 seconds

	Scaling appears to be linear.

Scoring (on the provided test blocks):

	Correctness:	100.0%
	Conformance:	100.0%

	Run the auto-timer to see Scalability results

Testing Conformance	(If we got this far, the tar file worked.)

	Found message, but ERROR was not in uppercase (1)
	Produced 'ERROR' message on missing or bad file name
	Help message check found all options

Quick Scalability Test:
	(For a more accurate test, run the auto-timer)

	T8k.i:  	0.031509 seconds
	T16k.i:  	0.032743 seconds
	T32k.i:  	0.02945 seconds

	T128k.i:  	0.027887000000000002 seconds

	The code may not work; 3 codes showed minimal growth
	This effect may also be timer variability.
	Run the auto-timer to see more accurate results.

	Scaling appears to be linear.

Scoring (on the provided test blocks):

	Correctness:	100.0%
	Conformance:	87.5%
