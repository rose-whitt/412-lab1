Testing Conformance	(If we got this far, the tar file worked.)

	Produced 'ERROR' message on missing or bad file name
	Help message check found all options

Quick Scalability Test:
	(For a more accurate test, run the auto-timer)

	T8k.i:  	0.011798 seconds
	T16k.i:  	0.017619 seconds
	T32k.i:  	0.027372 seconds
	T64k.i:  	0.048639 seconds
	T128k.i:  	0.091887 seconds

	Scaling appears to be linear.

Scoring (on the provided test blocks):

	Correctness:	100.0%
	Conformance:	100.0%

	Run the auto-timer to see Scalability results

Testing Conformance	(If we got this far, the tar file worked.)

	Found message, but ERROR was not in uppercase (1)
	Produced 'ERROR' message on missing or bad file name
	Help message check found all options

Quick Scalability Test:
	(For a more accurate test, run the auto-timer)

	T8k.i:  	0.06832099999999999 seconds
	T16k.i:  	0.069283 seconds

	T128k.i:  	0.066375 seconds

	The code may not work; 3 codes showed minimal growth
	This effect may also be timer variability.
	Run the auto-timer to see more accurate results.

	Scaling appears to be linear.

Scoring (on the provided test blocks):

	Correctness:	100.0%
	Conformance:	87.5%
