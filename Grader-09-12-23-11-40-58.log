Testing Conformance	(If we got this far, the tar file worked.)

	Found message, but ERROR was not in uppercase (1)
	Produced 'ERROR' message on missing or bad file name
	Help message check found all options

Quick Scalability Test:
	(For a more accurate test, run the auto-timer)

	T8k.i:  	0.069402 seconds
	T16k.i:  	0.06792400000000001 seconds
	T32k.i:  	0.06878000000000001 seconds
	T64k.i:  	0.06835899999999999 seconds
	T128k.i:  	0.069088 seconds

	The code may not work; 3 codes showed minimal growth
	This effect may also be timer variability.
	Run the auto-timer to see more accurate results.

	Scaling appears to be linear.

Scoring (on the provided test blocks):

	Correctness:	100.0%
	Conformance:	87.5%

	Run the auto-timer to see Scalability results
